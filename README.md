## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- *Language*: Python 3.x
- *Editor*: VS Code / Any Text Editor
- *Platform*: Command Line / Terminal

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📟 User-friendly CLI menu interface
- ➕ Supports Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
- ⚠ Handles invalid inputs and division by zero
- 🔁 Loop-based interaction until the user exits
- ✅ Clean function-based code structure
- 🧠 Follows Python best practices and naming conventions

## 📦 How to Run

Open your terminal and run the following:

```bash
python calculator.py

Make sure Python 3 is installed and configured in your system PATH.

💡 Sample Output

📟 Welcome to CLI Calculator!

Select operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Exit
Enter choice (1/2/3/4/5): 4
Enter first number: 12
Enter second number: 4

✅ Result: 12.0 / 4.0 = 3.0

🔍 Code Explanation

Function Definitions:

add(a, b) – Adds two numbers

subtract(a, b) – Subtracts second number from first

multiply(a, b) – Multiplies two numbers

divide(a, b) – Divides first number by second; handles divide-by-zero


Main Loop:

Displays a menu to the user

Takes input and validates it

Performs the corresponding operation

Continues until user selects Exit


Best Practices Followed:

Modular coding using functions

Input validation and error handling

Pythonic naming and clean structure

Readable CLI formatting and interaction
